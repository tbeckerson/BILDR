## Seriously, don't use this.

It's still very beta, and will cause you all sorts of headaches.
The core _bildr.css_ file is pretty decent, and the _bgc_ (background & text colours) files are funtional, but the _media_ files are a disaster.

TO DO:
+ Break _bildr.css_ into smaller pieces
+ more colour files
+ fix the media files, or devise a way to do text that works without media queries
+ grid layout needs work
+ a cheatsheet explaning all the abbreviations would be nice
